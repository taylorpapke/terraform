Notes
Replace https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git with the actual URL of your GitHub repo.
Ensure your repository does not require authentication for cloning (or use a secure method to include credentials if needed).
For production use, consider setting up an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and a domain name with Route 53.
This code provides a basic deployment setup, and it can be expanded to include more complex requirements, such as databases, load balancers, and auto-scaling. Let me know if you need further help with any customization!
